 AI-based ChatBot that can answer student questions about paper selection problems
This is a web and mobile based application. Students can access the website via the link:

  https://peaceful-eyrie-37568.herokuapp.com/
  
  *Or to access the Facebook Page Chatbot Team 1 and start Message. However, for current state, Messenger might not response you 
  because the App still under development and it needs to take couple days for Facebook to review our app. 

As the time limitation, the bot might not be trained well. Your question may be answered not properly. There are some sample questions you
  can ask. 'What is the pre-requisite paper for <paper name>?' 'What semester can I take <paper name>' 'What papers do I need to learn for Software Development?'
  'If I have failed <specific paper> what papers can't I take?'
  
  Or you can use keyword to ask the question, like pre-req, fail, softwaer development.
